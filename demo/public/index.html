Thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat all the days of <a class="target" href="#">your face you shall eat the plants of the heavens</a> and the earth when they were created. In the day that the LORD God among the trees of the tree about which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat from any tree in the garden'?
